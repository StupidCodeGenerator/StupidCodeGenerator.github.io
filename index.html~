		<h1>The B Game Website (Work in progress!)</h1>
		<h3>What is the B game?</h3>
		<p>
			To know the B game, you need to know the B movie first. Understanding the B movie was the reason I want
			to make this site. The B movie is a low-budget commercial motion picture that is not an arthouse film. 
			There was a lot of people want to make there own movie but without finacial supporting they can't make 
			something big but enough to express them self.</br>
			The B game is just like that. A lot of game developers, like me, they may have a lot of great ideas but
			the can't make it well in many reason. but they are still express them self in that way, and I think I
			should make a homeland for them.

		<h3>About this website:</h3>
		<p>
			As you can see, this website is still working in progress. I have a day job and I spend my spare time on 
			a small 2d game engine, my family and this website. I have a lot of ideas but I'm very sorry that I can't 
			finish all of them. Maybe I can't finish any of them. I think there will be alot of people just like me. 
			So if you have a good demo that can't finish, you can email that to me and I will post that on this site 
			to let people know.
