It depends on what you want! I have always made my own engines and I am glad I did. There is a certain kind of knowledge of programming that is becoming a lot more rare these days as many people use Unity or whatever. 

However, it depends on your priorities. If you would rather be making gameplay most of the time, then building an engine will take you away from that.

To make it more approachable, you could always start small, building a relative simple engine (maybe 2D at first) with a game around that, then build up the engine to something more complex for next time, etc. The problem most people run into when building an engine is that they start out very ambitious and try to build something that is just too big and beyond their current engine-building skills, and then they don't get it done and eventually give up. But I think with judicious choice of tasks you can avoid that.

以下是我发的原文，因为Blow据说所有的游戏引擎都自己写，我只是想问问作为开发者应不应该这样做。

I'm a game programmer from China and already spent 4 years making mobile games. I was always making games for commercial companies and now I start to realise that I really shoud make something for my own.

I don't know why but I really hate to read the docs and codes of commercial game engine. So these days I start to think about maybe I shoud make a small game engine and improve that day by day. If I do that maybe 3 or 4 years later I will never need commercial engine anymore.

But it will take 3 or 4 years right? I'm still not sure if I should do that. I think making a game engine will make me into a better programmer but It's really something big.

So I ask for your experience. I really enjoy you game Braid so I think you experience will be helpful.

Thanks
